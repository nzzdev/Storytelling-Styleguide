# Visuals Styleguide

This is built using http://www.catalog.style/

We use the standalone version of catalog as documented here: https://docs.catalog.style/installation/standalone

## Start locally

1. Open a Terminal
2. `cd the/path/to/catalog/folder`
3. run one of the following two commands: `npx http-server` or `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`
4. Check the output of the above command, it will tell you something about a port
5. Open a Browser and go to `localhost:8080` where you replace `8080` with whatever the above command told you about a port number

## Adding new Pages

1. Add the markdown file at the appropriate place in `/pages` folder
2. Add the page configuration in `index.html` file. See the already existing ones for examples
