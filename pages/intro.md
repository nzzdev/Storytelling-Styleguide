# About this documentation

This documentation is designed to collected and maintain the styles and visual language of the Neue Zürcher Zeitung's Visuals team. As each infographic, chart or data visulization varies from case to case, this documentation is meant to serve as a set of guidelines. Adhering to these guidelines leads to a more consistent presentation of design work in NZZ's print and online media.

This documentation is first and foremost for our team. We are designers, developers, data journalists, video reporters and motion designers. All of us have different needs and should be able to navigate around the guidelines that are outlined in the following pages.

### Component Stability Index

 In order to clearly indicate which components described in this documentation can be considered stable or unstable, we have introduced a «Stability Index». Each of the key components within the documentation can be matched to one of the three different stability levels described below.

```html|span-1,no-source,plain
<div class="stabilityIndex experimental">Experimental</div>
```
**DO NOT USE**: This concept is still under heavy construction and may be subject to profound change or completely removed.

```html|span-1,no-source,plain
<div class="stabilityIndex unstable">Unstable</div>
```
**USE WITH CAUTION**: The concept's functionality and styling are to be considered a «draft» and are not yet approved by all parties affected. There might still be some changes made in the near future.

```html|span-1,no-source,plain
<div class="stabilityIndex stable">Stable</div>
```
**IN USE**: Functionality and styling are complete and should not change unless serious issues are encountered. Stable concepts are approved by the team and can be  considered «ready-to-use».
