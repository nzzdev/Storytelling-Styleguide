Almost all basic charts for our online platform are done in Q. Only charts with details and annotations that are not possible in Q should be designed and uploaded through Q's Infographic tool. The print template for basic charts can be downloaded via the [assets page](assets).

Basic bar charts are usually used for showing categorized data over time or comparing. Stacking bars are also good when you want to show subdivisions in your dataset. Line charts can be used for change-over-time as well as showing correlations in time-based data sets.

All of the following definitions contain a tag in the bottom right corner which describes which medium the definition applies to.

## Axis & Axis Labeling
All basic charts that show quantitative data have a vertical and horizontal axis. In order to understand a graphic, the title, subtitle and axis labels need to be simple and concise.

### Y-Axis

#### Do
- right-align and equally space labels from y-axis lines
- for print, align axis line to the baseline of the label
- for online, center the axis line to the label
- directly label the y-axis when the type of value represented is not obvious to the reader
- reduce long numbers when possible (3,000 to 3 with "in Tausend" in subtitle)

#### Do not
- extend lines underneath/above labels

```image

src: "assets/basic-charts/bar-charts_axis@1x.png 1x, assets/basic-charts/bar-charts_axis@2x.png 2x"
```
```image
plain: true
span: 6
src: "assets/basic-charts/bar-charts_axis-print@1x.png 1x, assets/basic-charts/bar-charts_axis-print@2x.png 2x"
```
### X-Axis

#### Do
- remove year labels when several years are displayed and the *focus of the graphic is the trend*.
- When necessary, abbreviate the year to the last two digits for years between first and last.
- right-align and equally space labels from y-axis lines.

#### Do not
- Do not keep all full years in the axis.
- Do not extend lines underneath/above labels.

```

span: 6
src: "assets/basic-charts/bar-charts_axis-b-print@1x.png 1x, assets/basic-charts/bar-charts_axis-b-print@2x.png 2x"
```

### Direct Annotation

#### Do
- write axis directly when data is not specified in subtitle.
- simplify axis (remove) when values can be directly annotated.

#### Do not
- leave axes indescript.
- display axis and exact values directly annotated.

```image
plain: true
span: 6
src: "assets/basic-charts/bar-charts_axis-c@1x.png 1x, assets/basic-charts/bar-charts_axis-c@2x.png 2x"
```
```image
plain: true
span: 6
src: "assets/basic-charts/bar-charts_axis-c-print@1x.png 1x, assets/basic-charts/bar-charts_axis-c-print@2x.png 2x"
```

### Legends
Legends are a part of the introduction to the chart, so we place them prominently just above the data. Legends for basic charts are constructed with circles and 45 degree lines. All charts with filled areas receive filled circles for their legend definitions and all line charts receive lines (solid or dotted) for their definitions.
#### Do
- align legends to the left of the chart, even with titles and subtitles
- use dotted lines for prognosis or prediction in line charts
- use hatched areas for prognosis or prediction in bar charts
- use a light gray area for missing data and directly label it (n/a or no data) when possible

#### Do not
- put legend information below a chart or map
- used hatched areas for other use cases outside of prognosis or prediction

```

### Highlighting
Bringing attention to a specific data point or set of data points in a graphic helps us underline our graphic's message and focus our readers to the most important part of the chart. The most basic form of highlighting is to use shades of our visualization colors to give a heavier visual weight to the data in the spotlight.

#### Do
- give the data point (bar, line) in focus the darker, fuller opacity of a color
- give the secondary data points a lighter shade of their colors
- use the pre-defined lighter shades of a full color in the correct order  

#### Do not
- use a lesser transparent shade of a color and allow grid lines to show through
- use other colors in full opacity
- use other additional visual elements on top of the basic chart

plain: true
span: 6
src: "assets/basic-charts/bar-charts_highlighting@1x.png 1x, assets/basic-charts/bar-charts_highlighting@2x.png 2x"
```

### Annotations

#### Do
- directly annotation when space allows and it doesn't distract from the information being displayed
- use a point when marking the specific data point makes sense and is possible
- when there are too many data points (often by stock charts with a long history) use a line without a point to highlight a peak or a drop
- align all of the annotation text the same way to the line (bottom, top, centered)
- use a curved corner (not straight) when space allows and use a straight line when it doesn't
- try to keep the text of the annotation *short and sweet*

#### Do not
- overload a graphic with annotations (discuss with editorial staff how they can shorten their content)
- introduce a new line or point style without argumentation for the deviation from the style guide.
