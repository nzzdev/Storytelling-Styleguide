## Axis Labeling

We offer our readers a comfortable entry point to complex graphics like scatterplots. Lower the barriers by summarizing the dimensions used at a highly visible place. For better accessibility use everyday language and be more precise elsewhere/later.

## Annotations

We often want to highlight interesting dots in a scatterplot. Annotate dots directly as long as the text field doesn't cover other dots. Use conncetion lines to annotate the dots from outside. Use titles to group multiple annotations.
