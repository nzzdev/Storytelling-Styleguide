#### All graphics produced for elections should be done in Q. In the case that custom colors should be added to a Q graphic, please see the color assignments on the [color page](colors).

```

## Parliament Seats

Parliament seats are visualized as a semi-circle representing the layout of (the most) parliament rooms. The party's shares are ordered from left to right depending on subsequent policital orientations.

```image

```

Choose the semi-circle layout depending on the space available in print. If the graphic is made for 2 or more columns, annotate sectors directly and, if possible, use party abbreviations the reader is used to. If the exact number of seats is an important detail, set it next to the party title and put the seat changes in brackets. Use connection lines to annotate small sectors. If too many small sectors are stacked together use a color legend.
