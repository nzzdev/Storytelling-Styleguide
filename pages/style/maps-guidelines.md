#### Digital first
All maps are produced for digital use first. Simple maps that can be produced in Q, are produced in Q and then adapted for print if needed. Maps that are more complex and need manual work, are produced in Sketch/Illustrator for digital use, then adapted for print. 

#### Purpose
What's the map for? If its sole purpose is to tell the user where some place is, keep it as simple as possible. If the map itself makes a point or tells a story, invest in making it as clear as possible.

#### Clarity
We show what needs to be shown and remove what's not relevant to the map for the specific purpose. Sometimes we need rivers, sometimes we don't. Sometimes we need country names, sometimes we don't. Sometimes we need a relief, sometimes we need roads, sometimes neither. 

#### Projections
For maps of large countries or continents we always consider which map projection is best suited for what we need to show. We avoid the Mercator projection and use equal area or equidistant projections whenever possible (also, sometimes a globe works fine, too).

#### Use of geodata
When drawing lines or shapes on maps, we use geodata from reliable sources. We don't draw on maps by hand unless we can be absolutely sure that accuracy won't be an issue (e.g. highlighting a football stadium on a city map by drawing a polygon around it is fine).
