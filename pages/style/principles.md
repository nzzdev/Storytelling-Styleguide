Design principles articulate the fundamental goals that all decisions can be measured against. In our case, they are designed to keep the work from both print and web mediums moving toward an integrated visual language. Design principles are a tool for creating a better, more consistent experience for our readers and viewers. Our principles are simple, based on real work, and reflective of us. They enforce clarity and reduce ambiguity. We developed these principles to help us make critical decisions about what we’re creating and make it easier to decide between good work and great work.

**Determined** - Entschlossen
- Every graphic has a purpose and a message that becomes apparent immediately
- Clarity and readability is never sacrificed for beauty

**Accentuated** - Akzentuiert
- We highlight what's most important
- We guide the viewer

**Precise** - Präzis
- We use the best available data and take no shortcuts
- We use clear and simple language

**Authentic** - Authentisch
- Each graphic is reflective of our collective voice and vision as the NZZ Visuals team

# Our audience
We work for the readers and users of NZZ. Not to please the editors of NZZ. Not to please ourselves.
We work for an audience that is well-informed and curious. We assume they have a basic understanding of most of the topics we cover, but we never assume they are experts. Our graphics reflect this – they are accessible to anyone who's interested.

# Our guidelines for achieving these standards
In order that our graphics are successful in translating information and a message to our readers, it's important that we **introduce** readers to the content on first look at the graphic. So that they don't get lost in the more complex visuals that we create, we use explanatory elements and extras that help **guide** them. Because it's not always easy to put a condensed finding in perspective of a larger topic, we make sure we consider the addition of secondary information through graphic or textual means to **provide context**. Above all else, our job is to **communicate** information clearly and elegantly - therefore we never add decoration without purpose to our work.

## Introducing the reader to the data
The information we show through our graphics have a range of complexity. Our work is largely centered around breaking down complex themes or dense datasets, which means we need to find ways to display this information in an understandable format for our readers. Often we can count on basic chart types like bar and line charts to show our data but occasionally we use more complex visualizations that might require a little more introduction for our regular readers. No matter the complexity of the chart, we strive to create a clear introduction to each chart with a main message in the title. The following subtitle and legend provide a straight forward description of exactly what the chart is showing.

```

## Guiding the reader through the data
For more complex graphics or abstract topics it is sometimes helpful to provide the readers with an exact example of how they should read the information shown in the chart. When creating these snippets, take care to formulate them in a colloquial fashion. Read them out loud to see if they reflect the way you would explain the information to someone else. The reader should be able to use it as a template to interpret all other data points in the chart. Make sure to place the reading example in a prominent place, preferably to be read right after the introduction information (title, subtitle and legend).

```

## Putting things into context
Annotations are a great tool for giving additional context or highlighting interesting bits of information that would otherwise not be apparent to the reader.

## Communication over decoration
Use color, illustrations and icons to communicate and explain the data that you're displaying. When the illustration helps the reader get a better understanding of what they're looking at on the first look, then it's a good use of illustration. Illustrations and icons should add information and provide context to the data you're showing in the chart. The illustration should also not compete with the main message of the chart.

#### Do use illustration
- to give readers an entrance into complex dataset
- to provide context that is not included in the dataset
- when it can be a replacement for a lot of text or an image that will crowd or disturb the visual hierarchy

#### Do not use illustration
- as a decorative element to fill up empty space in a chart
- as the focal point of a visualization

Remember to try and reuse illustrations or icons to create consistency across our illustrative works

 ```


#### Do use a background color
- to balance the visual weight of the graphic with another image on the page
- to create a focal point in a sea of text
- to bring elements/separate charts in the same visualization together
- when it is a part of a series concept or lends itself to the topic (i.e. Outer Space)

#### Do not use a background color
- for online graphics when decreases the contrast for readability on the screen
- as an attempt to make a chart more interesting

Remember to leave enough space between design elements and the edge of a background. When type or charts bump up against the border of a background it creates irritation for the eye.
