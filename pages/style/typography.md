For online and print different font families are in use.

## Online

[GT America](http://www.gt-america.com/) and [PensumPro](https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typemates/pensum-pro/) are used as the primary fonts across all of our online products. A typographic scale is used to create a limited set of type sizes that work well together, while respecting intrinsic platform standards. Online font styles are implemented as [a sophie module](https://github.com/nzzdev/sophie-font).

## Styles

For both, Online and Print, we defined the same font styles, basically constisting of two these two groups: titles and notes.
While they can be translated from Online to Print, there are certain fallbacks on the Print side. This has to do with the fact that print fonts are generally smaller and therefore less dynamic in terms of size.

The following matrix showcases the translation of Online and Print fonts which is also takes place in our "Q-to-Print" workflow:
