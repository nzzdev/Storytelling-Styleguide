All basic graphics produced for elections should be done in Q. In the case that custom colors should be added to a Q graphic, please see the color assignments on the [color page](colors). Examples of exemptions from Q graphics include choropleth maps and arrow maps.

## Executive Election
For candidate images, please contact someone from the editorial photo/web production staff with the names of the candidates (#bild-aktuell in Slack is a good place to start). All portraits should be color with the backgrounds removed. To prepare the images in Q, there is a Sketch template file in the folder for Executive Election Q Tool.

## Parliament Seats

Parliament seats are visualized as a semi-circle representing the layout of (most) parliament rooms. The party's shares are ordered from left to right depending on subsequent political orientations.

#### Do
- if the graphic is made for 2 or more columns in print, annotate sectors directly
- use party abbreviations our readers are familiar with
- if the exact number of seats is an important detail, denote it next to the party title and put the seat change in brackets
- use connection lines to annotate small sectors
- if there are too many small sectors stacked together use a color legend
