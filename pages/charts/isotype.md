Isotype-charts are an alternative to barcharts. [Empirical reserach](http://steveharoz.com/research/isotype/) shows that under certain conditions, they lead to a better recall of the information presented.

## Symbols should represent data

According to the above mentioned research, using symbols to show quantities leads to higher retention of the data than simply using bars. «Labelling» the chart with an illustration doesn't improve retention on the other hand.
