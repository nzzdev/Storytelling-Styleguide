Scatterplots are a great way to show correlation between variables. Keep in mind that they are not intuitive for all audiences and can be overwhelmingly complex in appearance. We use labeling and annotation in the following ways to help provide guidance to our readers and a comfortable entry point into the graphic.

## Overlap
If your scatterplot has a lot of data points, there is potential for areas of heavy overlap. When this is the case: try using transparency as a tool to show the density of the data while still providing some ability to differentiate between points.

## Axis Labeling
You can also lower the barrier to entry by summarizing the dimensions used at a highly visible place. Use everyday language can make the graphic more accessible, for example: "younger" and "older" or "more precipitation" and "less precipitation." We complement the brevity in the charts with precision in the footnote or methodology section.

```image
plain: true
span: 6
src: "assets/scatter-slopes/scatterplot_axislabeling@1x.png 1x, assets/scatter-slopes/scatterplot_axislabeling@2x.png 2x"
```

## Annotations
Say you want to highlight an interesting correlation in your scatterplot.

#### Do
- annotate data points directly as long as the text field doesn't cover up other important data
- if the annotation is longer and requires more space: use connection lines to annotate the points from outside the chart
- use titles to group multiple annotations

```image
plain: true
span: 6
src: "assets/scatter-slopes/scatterplot_annotations@1x.png 1x, assets/scatter-slopes/scatterplot_annotations@2x.png 2x"
```
#### Do not
- draw extra elements to highlight groups, while this tends to unnecessarily clutter the chart

```image
plain: true
span: 6
src: "assets/scatter-slopes/scatterplot_annotations-print@1x.png 1x, assets/scatter-slopes/scatterplot_annotations-print@2x.png 2x"
```

## Slopes
We use slope charts typically to show change in data by displaying two points in time. These are great alternatives to the line chart, when we want to give our readers a more precise message. Keep date labels at the top of the slope chart, so that in the case of a tall graphic, the reader understands the time frame without having to scroll.

```
