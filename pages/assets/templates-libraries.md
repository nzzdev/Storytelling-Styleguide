# Templates & Libraries

Templates and libraries help us to quickly acccess predefined font styles and colors and reuse certain components. Further it provides us with the canvas sizes we're targeting.

We created templates for Illustrator and Sketch. In each of them you will find artboards optimized for the widths supported by NZZ' article view. Settings are in pixels and in RGB.

If the graphic needs to be optimized for print, Illustrator should be used – Sketch is a pixel-only editor.

## Sketch Template

Find the Sketch Template here (NZZ employees only access): https://nzzmg.sharepoint.com/:u:/s/nzz_st/EZH35lFjoYZLszQDxFQsl7UBcoCVbUensTpMir_AFAzWhA?e=7T3ipU

For print production an additional artboard and a base grid is provided. CMYK conversion is done by saving the exported PDF in the Asura folder (`smb://fs006/asura$/queues/070_Infografik/05_RGB_Black_to_100K`). After being processed, the output can be found inside PDF_OK (`smb://fs006/asura$/queues/070_Infografik/98_PDF_OK`)
