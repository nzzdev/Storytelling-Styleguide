# Google Earth 3D view

For data journalists or cases with a tight deadline, please refer to [the tutorial](https://3.basecamp.com/3500782/buckets/10878677/documents/1598132399#__recording_1793630293) in Basecamp.

For a more advanced version, take the following steps to create an graphic image:
- Find the best possible perspective in Google Earth Pro, download a screenshot
- Open the screenshot in Photoshop
- Retouch the photo by removing the background
- Soften the background by using 5% of Gaussian Blur (Gaußscher Weichzeichner)
- Place a 40% transparent, white layer over the background
- Remove the logo and text on the screenshot and put those references in the source field in Q once you create an infographic from the image (respectively place the information underneath the graphic in the print version)
- for all further additions including text and colored layers, refer to the definitions on the [color page](https://nzzdev.github.io/Storytelling-Styleguide/#/colors)
